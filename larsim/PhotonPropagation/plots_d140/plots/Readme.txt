1. Corro la simulacion con d<140 and chi>9 conditions for taken points and nothing else, the rest is parametrisation.

2. Corro la simulacion con all taken with chi>9.

3. Compare for Opdet #50 (49 in the fhicl) and #51 (50 in the fhicl) attenuation of the bars should be on the other side. 


Possible effects:
1. Spherical for parametrisation, hyperboloid for library.
2. Attenuation length.
3. Cooked in poisson statistics.
